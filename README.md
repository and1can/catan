We are only given data with the results. There is no test data and train data split. Thus, for certain learning algorithms, I must split the data into training data, validation data, and testing data to see how well the algorithm is learning. Since the dataset is kind of small (only 50), I was thinking of training on 25, validating on 10, and testing on 15. An alternative is to look for more data from playcatan.com. However, a thing to consider is that not all of the players will be the same. 


Anyways now a description of the columns in the data.

gameNum: each game I played has 4 corresponding rows, 1 per player.

player: the starting position corresponding to each row

points: how many points the player ended the game with (the game is won with 10 or more)

me: the position I played during the game
2, 3, ..., 12 - how many rolls of each value occurred during the game (game is played with 2 dice)

settlement1, settlement2 - each starting settlement is logged as 3 pairs of [number, resource]:

L = lumber

C = clay

S = sheep

W = wheat

O = ore

3G = 3:1 general port

2(X) = 2:1 port for resource X

D = desert
 
production: total cards gained from settlements and cities during game

tradeGain: total cards gained from peer AND bank trades during game

robberCardsGain: total cards gained from stealing with the robber, plus cards gained with non-knight development cards. A road building card is +4 resources.

totalGain: sum of previous 3 columns.

tradeLoss: total cards lost from peer AND bank trades during game

robberCardsLoss: total cards lost from robbers, knights, and other players' monopoly cards


tribute: total cards lost when player had to discard on a 7 roll (separate from previous column.)

totalLoss: sum of previous 3 columns.

totalAvailable:totalGain minus totalLoss.
